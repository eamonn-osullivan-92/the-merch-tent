The Lost Crates

A mock e-commerce record store built with React, Redux, SASS, ExpressJS, Sqlite3/Postgres.

Full stack project where users can add/remove to cart and place orders. Orders are saved in a database, and can be fetched with an order ID. State on the front end is managed using Redux and will persist via local storage. 

Wishlist when I have time: 
Authentication with admin rights to add/update products.
Users will only have access to orders they create.
